  "summary": "Successfully created and integrated a comprehensive authentication modal component that matches the v0 style shown in the user's images. The AuthModal component includes multiple authentication flows: sign-in with email, sign-up with email and phone number (as requested), Google OAuth integration, and a 6-digit verification code system. The modal features a dark theme matching the v0 design, with proper state management for different authentication steps (signin/signup/verify). Integrated this modal into the action screen to replace the previous registration section, with improved user flow where clicking 'Confirm & Continue' on the data preview opens the auth modal, and successful authentication shows a green success message.",
  "current_status": "The authentication system is fully functional with a modern, dark-themed modal that provides multiple sign-in/sign-up options including the requested phone number field. The component follows the v0 design pattern exactly, with proper validation, auto-focus on verification inputs, and seamless integration with the existing action screen workflow. No linting errors present and ready for use."
