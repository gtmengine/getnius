  "summary": "User requested to replace the pill-based column selector with a Google Sheets-style table interface. I completely replaced the ColumnSelector component with a new Excel/Google Sheets-style design that includes: column headers bar with clickable headers, sample data rows for visual context, row numbers, column letters (A, B, C, etc.), selection indicators (blue top border for selected columns), suggestion indicators (gray dashed border for AI-suggested columns), and an 'Add Custom' button. The interface shows selected columns in blue, available columns in white, and suggested columns in gray with plus icons. I also updated the EnrichmentScreen to work with the new column structure and fixed TypeScript errors by mapping new column names to existing Company properties.",
  "current_status": "Successfully implemented Google Sheets-style column selector with full Excel/Google Sheets interface including headers, sample data, row numbers, column letters, and visual selection states. The component is fully functional with proper TypeScript support and integrates seamlessly with the existing EnrichmentScreen."
