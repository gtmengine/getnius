  "summary": "Fixed the search functionality by correcting the handleSearch dependency array to include searchQuery, ensuring the function has access to the current search state. Also fixed the callback dependencies for handleSuggestionSelect and handleExampleSelect to properly reference handleSearch. Added a debug indicator to show when search is ready to execute.",
  "current_status": "Search functionality should now work correctly. Users can type in the search bar, see their query displayed in a debug indicator, and trigger search by clicking the Search button or pressing Enter. The search will properly execute with the current query value."
