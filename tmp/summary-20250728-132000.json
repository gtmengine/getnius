  "summary": "User requested to implement a Google Sheets-style column selector component for the EnrichmentScreen. I created a new ColumnSelector component with the exact design specifications: blue pills for selected columns with X icons to remove, gray pills for unselected columns, and an 'Add Custom' button. The component includes proper accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation), exact color specifications (#E0F2FF background for selected, #F3F4F6 for unselected), and responsive design. I then updated the EnrichmentScreen to use the new component, replacing the old pill-based system with the new state management structure using string arrays for availableColumns, suggestedColumns, and selectedColumns. The table headers and data cells were updated to work with the new column structure.",
  "current_status": "Successfully implemented Google Sheets-style column selector with all specified requirements: visual design matches specifications, proper state management, accessibility features, and responsive behavior. The EnrichmentScreen now uses the new ColumnSelector component with improved UX and cleaner code structure."
