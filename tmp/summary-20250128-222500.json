Replaced the single static URL input with an intelligent dynamic system that auto-generates new fields when the current one is filled, includes individual field clearing/removal capabilities, real-time URL validation with visual feedback, clickable URL previews, smart placeholder text, and a progress counter. The system maintains at least one field at all times and provides smooth UX with hover-based action buttons and proper keyboard navigation.",
