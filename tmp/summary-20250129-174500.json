  "summary": "Successfully implemented advanced grid rendering for SpreadsheetScreen using CSS gradients instead of individual cell borders. This major performance optimization replaces the previous border-based approach with: (1) CSS gradient-based grid lines using linear-gradient for both horizontal and vertical lines, (2) CSS custom properties for flexible grid configuration (--grid-cell-width, --grid-cell-height, etc.), (3) Enhanced visual styling with better headers, selection indicators, and hover effects, (4) Improved range selection showing entire rows/columns when headers are clicked, (5) Performance overlay for heavy datasets using repeating-linear-gradient, and (6) Professional spreadsheet appearance with shadows, gradients, and smooth transitions. The grid now scales much better and eliminates the performance bottleneck of thousands of individual DOM borders.",
  "current_status": "Advanced grid rendering completed successfully. The SpreadsheetScreen now uses CSS gradients for clean, scalable grid lines. Remaining wolf-table improvements include: viewport virtualization (pending), robust selection with shift+arrow navigation (pending), formula layer with dependency graph (pending), improved CSV ingestion (pending), and enhanced column operations (pending). The application is running on localhost:3000 with all major architectural improvements (sparse data model, undo/redo system) now in place."
