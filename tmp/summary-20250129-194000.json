  "summary": "Successfully implemented mock search functionality for the spreadsheet with comprehensive debug logging. Added mock company data (OpenAI, Anthropic, Stability AI) that returns when EXA_API_KEY is missing, enabling testing without real API keys. Added detailed console logging throughout the entire search flow including API calls, data formatting, and spreadsheet population. Interface remains completely unchanged as requested - users see the same UI but now have working search functionality with debug visibility.",
  "current_status": "Search functionality is now testable with mock data and extensive debugging. Ready for user testing to identify any remaining issues with spreadsheet population. All hydration errors have been resolved and dev server is running smoothly."
