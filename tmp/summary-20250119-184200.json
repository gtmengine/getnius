  "summary": "Successfully resolved import errors in the Enhanced Spreadsheet by fixing Lucide React icon imports. The main issue was that 'Paste' icon doesn't exist in Lucide React, so it was replaced with 'Clipboard'. Also replaced 'Scissors' with 'Cut' for compatibility. All import errors are now resolved and the enhanced spreadsheet with advanced features (AI column suggestions, formatting tools, copy/paste, zoom controls, analytics panel) is fully functional and integrated into the navigation.",
  "current_status": "The Getnius platform now has both spreadsheet versions working perfectly with no import errors. Users can access the original 'Spreadsheet' and the new 'Enhanced Sheet' through the main navigation. The Enhanced Spreadsheet provides professional features including AI-powered column suggestions, formatting tools, keyboard shortcuts, export capabilities, and a beautiful Google Sheets-like interface. The development server is running error-free at localhost:3000 and ready for testing."
