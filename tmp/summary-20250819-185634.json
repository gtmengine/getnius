  "summary": "Successfully modified the action-screen.tsx to add a spreadsheet preview section and user registration section as requested. The spreadsheet preview shows a minimized table format with company data (up to 3 rows visible) and includes a blue disclaimer box asking users to confirm their data before proceeding. Below that, a user registration section was added with Google sign-in option (complete with Google logo) and alternative email/phone number registration form. Both sections are conditionally rendered based on user interaction flow - the spreadsheet preview shows first, and upon confirmation, the registration section appears. The existing 'Take Action on Your List' content remains intact and positioned below the new sections as specified.",
  "current_status": "The action screen now has the complete user flow: 1) Spreadsheet data preview with confirmation disclaimer, 2) User registration options (Google OAuth or email/phone), and 3) The original export/outreach/monitoring functionality. All components are properly integrated with state management and event handlers for smooth user interaction."
