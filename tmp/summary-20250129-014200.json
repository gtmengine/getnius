  "summary": "Successfully added the Source column back to the table as a manageable column through the column selector system. Added 'Source' to availableColumns array, included it in default selectedColumns, enhanced getColumnValue function to handle Source with colored badges, and removed the hardcoded Source column from table body. Source column now maintains its visual styling while being fully integrated into the column management system.",
  "current_status": "Source column is now properly integrated into the column management system with colored badges for different sources (firecrawl=purple, google=blue, exa=green) and can be toggled/reordered like any other column."
