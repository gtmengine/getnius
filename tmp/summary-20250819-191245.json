  "summary": "Successfully updated the authentication modal branding from 'v0' to 'GetNius' throughout the component. Changed the logo from 'v0' to 'GN' (GetNius initials) in the circular white badge, and updated all text references including titles 'Sign in to GetNius', 'Sign up to GetNius', and descriptions to use 'GetNius' instead of 'v0/Vercel account'. The modal now properly represents the GetNius brand while maintaining the same professional design and functionality.",
  "current_status": "The authentication modal is fully branded for GetNius with consistent naming throughout all authentication flows (sign-in, sign-up, verification). The component maintains the same dark theme and professional appearance while now properly representing the GetNius platform instead of v0."
