  "summary": "Successfully implemented the first major improvements from the wolf-table level optimization guide. Completed sparse data model transformation replacing array-of-all-cells with Map<CellKey, CellVal> for O(1) lookups, implemented full useReducer with undo/redo history supporting Ctrl+Z/Ctrl+Y, enhanced CSV loading to preserve state and IDs using batch operations. Fixed all major cell interaction handlers, query submission logic, and column operations to work with the new sparse data architecture. Added proper keyboard shortcuts and visual feedback for undo/redo states.",
  "current_status": "Original spreadsheet screen now has wolf-table level performance foundations with sparse data model, reducer-based state management, and proper undo/redo. Ready to continue with grid alignment improvements, viewport virtualization, and enhanced selection model. The spreadsheet now handles large datasets efficiently and maintains proper data consistency."
