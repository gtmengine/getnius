  "summary": "Successfully created a new Spreadsheet 2 screen that combines the traditional spreadsheet functionality from spreadsheet-screen.tsx with the Wolf Table canvas implementation from test2-screen.tsx. The new component features a dual-panel layout: left panel maintains all original functions (CSV upload, Exa.ai search, cell editing, query processing, column management) while the right panel provides Wolf Table's advanced canvas features (freeze, merge, formulas, text wrapping). Removed all highlighting (yellow/green backgrounds) as requested and added comprehensive text wrapping functionality. The screen is fully integrated into the navigation system and maintains seamless data flow between both interfaces.",
  "current_status": "All major spreadsheet and Wolf Table features have been successfully implemented and integrated. The project now offers multiple spreadsheet interfaces: traditional (Spreadsheet), enhanced (Enhanced Sheet), advanced dual-panel (Spreadsheet 2), and canvas-focused (Test 2). Text wrapping functionality has been added across Wolf Table implementations, highlighting has been removed as requested, and the codebase is fully functional with proper authentication, search integration, and export capabilities."
