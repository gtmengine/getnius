  "summary": "Fixed tabindex conflicts that were causing elements to change unexpectedly. Resolved the issue where multiple elements had the same tabIndex={1} by giving each element a unique tabindex value. Now the search input has tabIndex={1}, search button has tabIndex={2}, category buttons have tabIndex={3-7}, and custom category elements have tabIndex={9}.",
  "current_status": "Tabindex conflicts resolved. Each element now has a unique tabindex value, preventing unexpected element changes during keyboard navigation. The interface should now behave consistently when using Tab key."
