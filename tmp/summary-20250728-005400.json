  "summary": "Fixed the search bar focus issue by completely rewriting the FastAutocomplete component to provide a Google-like seamless typing experience. Removed complex state management and focus restoration logic that was causing interruptions. The component now uses simple, direct input handling with natural suggestion behavior. Also enhanced the spreadsheet functionality to show only relevant companies in the Enrich tab while keeping non-relevant ones in a collapsed list at the top of the Search tab.",
