  "summary": "Fixed the persistent search bar focus issue in FastAutocomplete component by simplifying state management, removing unnecessary useEffect hooks that caused re-renders, and adding onMouseDown preventDefault() to suggestion buttons. The component now uses a single isFocused state instead of complex showSuggestions logic, and suggestions only appear when focused with available results. This should provide a seamless typing experience similar to Google search without losing focus during character input.",
  "current_status": "Search bar focus issue has been addressed through component refactoring. The FastAutocomplete component has been simplified to prevent unnecessary re-renders and maintain focus during typing. The user rejected installing additional npm modules, so the fix was implemented within the existing component structure. Ready for testing to confirm the focus issue is resolved."
