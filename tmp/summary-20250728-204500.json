  "summary": "Fixed the duplicate smart suggestions issue by updating the AutoCompleteSearch component to use the API instead of local suggestion generation. Added proper duplicate prevention in the suggestions API and added debugging logs to track suggestion generation. The component now fetches suggestions from the API and falls back to local suggestions if the API fails.",
  "current_status": "Smart suggestions should now work properly without duplicates. The system fetches suggestions from the API and displays them correctly. Debug logs have been added to help track any remaining issues with suggestion generation."
