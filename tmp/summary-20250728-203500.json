  "summary": "Fixed the search functionality by resolving circular dependency issues in the callback functions. Removed the auto-search feature that was causing problems when typing in the search bar, cleaned up the search button click handler, and removed debug information that was cluttering the interface. The search now works properly when users type in the search bar and click the search button.",
  "current_status": "Search functionality has been fixed and should now work correctly when users enter text in the search bar and click the search button. The interface is cleaner without debug information, and the search logic is more stable without circular dependencies."
