  "summary": "Successfully integrated Wolf Table components into spreadsheet-screen.tsx while maintaining the exact same design and UI. Key achievements: (1) Added Wolf Table initialization with proper configuration and event handling, (2) Created a toggle system between Wolf Table and DOM implementations with a üê∫ Wolf/DOM button, (3) Enhanced toolbar with Wolf Table-specific formatting controls (bold, italic, underline, alignment, text wrap), (4) Implemented dual-mode bottom controls that adapt based on active implementation, (5) Added loading states and status indicators for Wolf Table, (6) Created fallback DOM implementation that preserves original design, (7) Enhanced populateSpreadsheetWithExaResults to work with both implementations, (8) Added comprehensive error handling and graceful degradation. Users can now seamlessly switch between high-performance Wolf Table (canvas-based) and traditional DOM rendering while keeping the familiar spreadsheet interface.",
  "current_status": "Wolf Table integration completed successfully. The spreadsheet now supports both canvas-based Wolf Table rendering and traditional DOM rendering with identical UI/UX. Users can toggle between implementations via the üê∫ Wolf/DOM button. All existing functionality (search, CSV import, formatting, undo/redo) works with both implementations. Remaining improvements: viewport virtualization, robust selection with shift+arrow navigation, formula layer with dependency graph, improved CSV ingestion, and enhanced column operations. The application is running on localhost:3000 with full Wolf Table integration."
