  "summary": "Successfully created a complete editable spreadsheet screen that mimics Google Sheets interface exactly as requested. Built a fully functional SpreadsheetScreen component with cell editing (click to select, double-click to edit), column headers (A, B, C...), row numbers, toolbar with formatting options, formula bar, and bottom controls for adding rows. Integrated the spreadsheet into the main application flow by adding it to the modules array and creating an 'Edit in Spreadsheet' button in the Action screen export options. The spreadsheet supports inline editing, auto-focus between cells, keyboard navigation (Enter/Escape), and dynamic row addition (1, 10, 100, 1000 rows). Styled to match Google Sheets with gray headers, white cells, blue selection highlighting, and proper borders.",
  "current_status": "The editable spreadsheet screen is fully functional and integrated with the main Getnius application. Users can now navigate from the Action screen to the spreadsheet view, edit data inline, add rows dynamically, and have a complete Google Sheets-like experience. The component includes proper state management, keyboard controls, and visual feedback matching the reference design shown by the user."
