  "summary": "Successfully cloned Wolf Table library locally and created a reliable local implementation. Replaced external CDN loading with local files in public/lib/, created TypeScript wrapper with proper error handling, and updated both Spreadsheet2 and Test2 screens to use the local Wolf Table. Fixed WrapText button to work on selected cells only. This eliminates network dependency and provides faster, more reliable table loading.",
  "current_status": "Wolf Table is now fully localized with TypeScript support. Text wrapping functionality is implemented for selected cells. Both Test2 and Spreadsheet2 screens use the local Wolf Table implementation. Ready for testing the improved reliability and wrap functionality."
