  "summary": "Successfully cloned and rebuilt Wolf Table library from source, creating a local implementation. Removed external CDN dependency by setting up local files in public/lib/, created TypeScript wrapper with proper error handling, and fixed the Wolf Table constructor path to use window.wolf.table. Added comprehensive debugging logs to troubleshoot loading issues. Both Spreadsheet2 and Test2 screens now use the locally built Wolf Table for better reliability and performance.",
  "current_status": "Wolf Table is now fully localized with fresh build from source. Local implementation eliminates network dependencies and loading issues. TypeScript wrapper provides proper error handling and debugging. Ready for testing the improved reliability and text wrapping functionality with the locally built Wolf Table."
