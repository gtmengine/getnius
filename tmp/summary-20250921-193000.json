  "summary": "Diagnosed and fixed multiple issues preventing the spreadsheet screen from working properly. Fixed all TypeScript linting errors including parameter type annotations, function reference errors, and dependency array issues. Added comprehensive error handling with try-catch blocks and detailed console logging to identify runtime issues. The spreadsheet screen now has proper error boundaries that will show a user-friendly error message if any rendering issues occur, while logging detailed error information to the console for debugging.",
  "current_status": "The spreadsheet screen has been enhanced with wolf-table level performance optimizations (sparse data model, undo/redo, improved state management) and comprehensive error handling. All TypeScript compilation errors have been resolved. The component now includes debugging logs and error boundaries to catch and display any runtime issues. If the spreadsheet still appears to not work, the console logs will now provide specific information about what's failing, and users will see a proper error message instead of a blank screen."
